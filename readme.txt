== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Created note is not draggable. Why?
This plugin uses jQuery library and jQuery UI. In some situations there are multiple jQuery libraries included in document footer and head. In most cases this problem appears when there is jQuery included after jQuery UI. Check if there is jQuery included after jQuery UI.

Note is not in exact location where I sticked it.
This happens when website is with responsive design and  you are viewing notes in non desktop version. This plugin is optimized on desktop resolutions.
